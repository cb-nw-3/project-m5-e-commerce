          "Olympic timing technology has come a long way in the last century.
          And thank goodness, as we've seen increasingly more races that have
          come down to not just the wire, but the itty-bitty strings that make
          up the wire. Take 2008, when swimmer Michael Phelps finished
          one-hundredth of a second before competitor Milorad Cavic. The digital
          evidence taken from a camera recording 100 frames a second was able to
          confirm that Phelps won the gold by that slimmest of margins."
