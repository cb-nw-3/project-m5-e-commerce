=======
Before you start, link your forked repo to the main one we are using above. This step should be done only ONCE.
>>>>>>> 6f99e821cb5bb111e2ebadab9ff8874a38bc536c

1. Pull from the `master` repo with
||||||| 50be0e6
You have your assignment and your team. What should you do first? This will vary for every team, and even every team member.
=======
- `git remote --v` (check your current remotes)
- `git remote add parent https://github.com/g-thinh/project-m5-e-commerce.git`
>>>>>>> 6f99e821cb5bb111e2ebadab9ff8874a38bc536c

<<<<<<< HEAD
- `git pull origin master`
||||||| 50be0e6
**The important thing is to NOT just jump in and start coding!**
=======
The basic workflow should have you fetch the latest version of the main repo before starting to work on any tasks/features.
>>>>>>> 6f99e821cb5bb111e2ebadab9ff8874a38bc536c

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Start working on your features and when you are ready to create a PR
||||||| 50be0e6
There probably shouldn't be any coding until very near the end of the first day.
=======
### 1. Fetch and merge the latest commits from the main `parent` repo.
>>>>>>> 6f99e821cb5bb111e2ebadab9ff8874a38bc536c

<<<<<<< HEAD
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "insert message here"`
- `git push origin master` or `git push origin HEAD`
||||||| 50be0e6
## Meet your Product Manager!
=======
ALWAYS do this if other members pinged the slack channel for a merged PR BEFORE sending your PR request so that you are not behind in commits.
>>>>>>> 6f99e821cb5bb111e2ebadab9ff8874a38bc536c

<<<<<<< HEAD
3. Once completed, you can now request a PR to the main fork
||||||| 50be0e6
Each team has been assigned a product manager. This person is in charge of answering questions, guiding you and basically preventing everything from falling apart!
=======
- `git fetch parent master`
- `git merge parent/master`
>>>>>>> 6f99e821cb5bb111e2ebadab9ff8874a38bc536c

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Same PR steps for workshops except now it should be from your forked repo to the main repo.
||||||| 50be0e6
This person should be present for some of your team meetings, but not all. PMs are super busy people and have multiple projects, people to manage. ðŸ˜‰
=======
### 2. Once you are done working on a task and are ready to send a PR

4.  (OPTIONAL)
||||||| 50be0e6
## Planning

1. You will break into 3 groups (with your assigned PM.)
2. Your PM will answer any initial questions, and give you more information, as required.
3. Breakout into a separate meeting with just your team. _Your PM will bounce from team to team to make sure you're on track._
4. Time to use the [Kickoff Meeting Agenda](__documentation/KICKOFF_MEETING_AGENDA.md)

### First team meeting

It could also be a good/fun idea to give yourselves an original team name. :)

Your first team meeting should start with the [Kickoff Meeting Agenda](__documentation/KICKOFF_MEETING_AGENDa.md).
